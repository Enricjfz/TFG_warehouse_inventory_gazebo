# TFG_warehouse_inventory_gazebo
This is the repository of my TFG named warehouse_inventory_gazebo which consist in a drone performing the task of doing
the inventory of a warehouse. The simulation runs in a software named Gazebo and all the code is programmed in a framework
named Aerostack (https://github.com/cvar-upm/aerostack/wiki) which uses ROS in its background. The repository also contains
two models obstacles (a forklift and a wheelbarrow) which are used to increase the complexity of the simulation.
